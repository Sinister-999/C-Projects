List.c - This file creates a bi directionaly Linked List ADT and adds constructor, deconstructor, access, and manipulation functions for the ADT.
List.h - This file allows Matrix.c, Sparse.c and MatrixTest.c to use the ADT and ADT functions made in List.c
ListTest.c - This file includes all the Test I did to test all the ADT access, manipulation, and constructor and deconstructor functions. This file is not used in the main files, this file is simply for testing purposes.
Matrix.c - This file creates a Matrix ADT and adds a constructor, deconstructor, access, and manipulation functions for the ADT
Matrix.h - This file allows Sparse.c and MatrixTest.c to use the Graph ADT and its functions made in Matrix.c
MatrixTest.c - This file includes all the Test I did to test all the ADT access, manipulation, and constructor and deconstructor functions. This file is not used in the main files, this file is simply for testing purposes.
Sparse.c - This file is the main function of this program, it takes two command line arguments, an input and output file, The program then will calculations of the two matrices provided.
Makefile - This file complies List.c, List.h, Matrix.c, Matrix.h, MatrixTest.c, and Sparse.c and outputs it as a program Sparse.
