List.c - This file creates a bi directionaly Linked List ADT and adds constructor, deconstructor, access, and maipulation functions for the ADT.
List.h - This file allows Lex.c and ListTest.c to use the ADT and ADT functions made in List.c
Lex.c - This is the main function of the program, It will takes three total arguments on the command line to run "./Lex <input-file> <output-file>. It will read all the lines from the input file and sort them alphanumerically based on ASCII values and output them line by line onto the output file.
Makefile - This file complies List.c List.h and Lex.c and outputs it as a progrom Lex.
ListTest.c - This file includes all the Test I did to test all the ADT access, manipulation, and constructor and deconstructor functions. This file is not used in the main files Lex.c, this file is simply for testing purposes.
